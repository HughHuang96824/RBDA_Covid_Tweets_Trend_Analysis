###GetTweet
This part is doing a parallely download and filter of tweet data using Twitter API and spark.

According to Twitterâ€™s Terms of Service, only Tweet IDs of the collected Tweets can be released publicly.
The tweet IDs used for this part is from https://ieee-dataport.org/open-access/coronavirus-covid-19-tweets-dataset

Basically there are four types of tweet according to (https://gwu-libraries.github.io/sfm-ui/posts/2016-11-10-twitter-interaction)
* A tweet
* A tweet that is a retweet
* A tweet that is a quote
* A tweet that is a reply
To avoid repeated counts, we filtered out all the tweets that is a retweet(Since a tweet can be retweeted for many times and the full_text are basically the same).
